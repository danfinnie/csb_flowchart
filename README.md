There's a lot of handcrafted JS/HTML, not too much in the way of autogenerated stuff I'm afraid.  I made the initial diagram in Visio, then manually put the coordinates into a JSON file.  I've attached the source Visio files (I'm assuming that the one labelled 2 is more recent but I'm not sure).  If course prerequisites have changed then you would need to update the Visio diagram, re-export the picture with the arrows, and then update the JSON file with the new prereqs as well.  If you want to move boxes around then you need to update the Visio diagram, remember which ones you moved, and update the JSON file with the new coordinates (Visio has a size and position dialog box which I copied them from).
